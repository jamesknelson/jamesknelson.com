					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to say how much I appreciate your articles.  They are consistently well-written, clear, relevant, and informative.

I&#039;m at the point where I&#039;m not learning anything new from them myself, but they serve as great tutorials for anyone still in the earlier stages of learning the React ecosystem.

I keep a list of high-quality React and Redux articles over at https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links.  I&#039;ve got a couple of your articles in that list already, and this one is absolutely going in the &quot;Performance&quot; section.

Thanks!]]></description>
