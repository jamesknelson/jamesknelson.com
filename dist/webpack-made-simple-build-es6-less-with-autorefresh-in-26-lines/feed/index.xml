					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Webpack is the least retarded piece of software I’ve used that’s written in JS.&quot;
Webpack is the MOST retarded, stupid, and non-intuitive, piece of junk I&#039;ve used. It bogs down creativity, speed, and workflow.

Look around. You see the same &quot;tutorials&quot; written over and over and over by different people. WHY? And when you create your own workflow and try to solve it using webpack, you will eventually realize what a pain in the arse time waster nonsense this is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not so convinced by your statement &quot;long, complicated Gulpfiles and Gruntfiles.&quot;.

first, the complexity does not equals to line of configurations, as long as configuration is simple and easy to use, it doesn&#039;t matter that we need a few more lines.

second, grunt and gulp do not require you to write your javascript modules to follow any commonjs or requirejs standards. which means that you don&#039;t need to declare &quot;require, exports&quot; everywhere, and you can use so many existing open source without putting them into &quot;shim&quot; mode.
But by using webpack, we have to declare these &quot;require&quot; so that webpack can find out the dependencies.  ( I had done a lot with requirejs a few years ago, and requirejs can also compile the bundle with r.js, as same as webpack)


Back to the problems you want to resolve in this article, don&#039;t you agree they are easy when using grunt or gulp?  

Probably, after ES6 becomes standard and everyone starts to write javascript component, and then, webpack will have some advantage there..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/webpack-made-simple-build-es6-less-with-autorefresh-in-26-lines/#comment-6378&quot;&gt;Will Myers&lt;/a&gt;.

EDIT Re previous comment - webpack-dev-server actually does not make the output config redundant, as (for example) the filename is used in the index.html. But it is still confusing that webpack-dev-server does not create any output bundle file. The argument seems to be that you don&#039;t need to have a bundle file in dev mode, but I would disagree with this. I&#039;ve implemented the https://github.com/gajus/write-file-webpack-plugin which forces webpack to write a bundle file]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this clearly written post. One point is that webpack-dev-server does not generate a bundle.js by default. So the moment you start using it, the output config becomes redundant. This is confusing - various people are asking for a flag to generate the bundle at https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/62]]></description>
