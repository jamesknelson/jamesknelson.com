					<description><![CDATA[I was surprised that the console output in exercise 1 was always a single character - I expected the input field(s) to store each character, and concatenate them to form the input string.  Clearly, the data returned in the (synthetic) element callback is formed by concatenating the current value property, and the entered character, because the tutorial code certainly never does the concatenation, and the fields are correctly concatenated in ex. 2.  I notice that in ex. 1, I can get more than one character to be logged by pasting in a string into the input field - a paste is obviously considered to be a single input event.]]></description>

I too am unable to view them. The JSBin sections show a loading bin, but it never loads for me. 

My internet is fine as I can go to other websites.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,  Great article!  I am a designer and don&#039;t develop daily.  I am familiar with React and worked for a start-up that used React as framework.  I gained more understanding of how React works by working through your exercises.  Thanks for taking the time to put this together!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your tutorials, very nicely done!

I do have a question, though. Why use this...
`state.contacts.slice(0).concat(contact)`

...and not just this:
`state.contacts.concat(contact)`

What advantage does slicing have in this scenario?]]></description>
