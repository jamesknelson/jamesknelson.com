					<description><![CDATA[&quot;prepublish&quot;: &quot;npm run compile&quot;

this automatic script is good. but in some case, npm will not publish the lib/ dir randomly.

if somebody ran into this issue, just remove this script and compile manual before publish.

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; However, my recommendation is to keep the options to your command-line tools on the command line.

I would argue instead that you should keep your config options for your project in a config file.

Just because you *can* pass something as a command line argument doesn&#039;t mean that&#039;s the right way to do it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the awesome guide! I really liked how you cleared up the usage of polyfill/runtime.

However, I&#039;m a bit troubled how to run our applications in production. The official documentation states that you should not use babel-node in production: &quot;You should not be using babel-node in production. It is unnecessarily heavy, with high memory usage due to the cache being stored in memory. You will also always experience a startup performance penalty as the entire app needs to be compiled on the fly.&quot;

But the docs doesn&#039;t say anything about the require-hook / babel-register. My understanding is that they are quite similar in function, they both compile on the fly and cache files and they both include the polyfill. So, if you want to run your application in production properly, is the only way to transpile ahead of time? I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing a guide on this topic ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can you help me with compile decorators? I wrote the following commands:
$ npm install -g babel-cli
$ npm install babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-0 --save-dev
$ npm install core-decorators --save

Ð¡reate file with name src/main.js:
https://github.com/jayphelps/core-decorators.js#readonly

The last command:
$ babel --presets es2015,stage-0 -d lib/ src/

Result in console:
src\main.js -&#062; lib\main.js

result in file:
&#039;use strict&#039;;

var _coreDecorators = require(&#039;core-decorators&#039;);

function _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(&quot;Cannot call a class as a function&quot;); } }

var Meal = function Meal() {
  _classCallCheck(this, Meal);
};

var dinner = new Meal();
