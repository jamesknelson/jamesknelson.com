					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Server-side rendering gives your app a few milliseconds faster load time on the first page load&quot;

This is an understatement, the increase in speed depends on network latency, number of data fetches etc and can often run into seconds on slow / mobile networks. Page load speed isn&#039;t a luxury - it directly impacts on user&#039;s impressions of the quality of a site, and has been shown to directly correlate with user bounce rate by Amazon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I humbly disagree. The hash tag in the URL is a barrier to a true hypermedia service that can exist in a browser just as it would in a under-the-hood http client using the API. 

Plus, having the full address means seeing the address as the referrer, which means server access logs and error logs go from an endless sea of &quot;http://blah.com/index.php&quot; to &quot;http://blah.com/cars/xyz&quot; (&quot;hmm, seems like a lot of incoming requests are for that one record. That&#039;s interesting. Oh look! A picture of boobs!&quot; Or &quot;you say the page fails to load &#039;randomly&#039;? Oh hey, looks like errors always trace back to these addresses! Always records where there is a special character in the title! Thank goodness I wasn&#039;t depending on you to notice!&quot;)

I agree that using the history API with expectations of huge performance boosts is probably unrealistic. But there are benefits similar to SEO that aren&#039;t actually dealing with search engine indexing.  Having the data mappable and visible at both the server level and client level is *not* a bad thing.]]></description>
